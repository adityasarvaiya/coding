Check if the given linked list is a palindrome. 

A linked list is said to be palindrome if,
the value of the first and last node is same and
that of second and second to last is same and so on.

Input format
First-line contains T, number of test cases. For each test case -
First-line contains N, the number of elements in the linked list.
The next line contains N space-separated integers, elements of the linked list.

Output format
For each test case, print “Yes” if the linked list is palindrome otherwise print “No”

Constraints
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 10^5
|A[i]| <= 10^9

Input:
2
5
1 2 2 2 1
3
3 1 1

Output:
Yes
No

Explanation:
1->2->2->2->1 is a palindrome
3->1->1 is not a palindrome as 3 != 1
