Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Input:
You are given the root node and the sum.

Output:
Number of paths from root to leaf whose path-sum is equal to given sum.

Constraints:
1<= value of nodes <=10000
1<= number of nodes <=100000

Example:
========
Tree given with root as 5.
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1

sum given=22

Output:
2

Explanation:

There are two paths from root to leaf whose sum is equal to 22:
[5,4,11,2]
[5,8,4,5]
