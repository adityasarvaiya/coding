Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods(A,B,C) and n disks. All the disks are of distinct size and initially they are placed on rod A in sorted order of their size with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The other rods B and C are initially empty. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from A to another rod C with the help of rod B, obeying the following simple rules:

1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) Larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Disks are numbered from 1 to n where 1 is the smallest disk and n is the largest.

Input:
An integer n denoting the number of disks.

Output:
In each new line, print the disk number you are moving, rod from which you are moving the disk and the rod to which you are moving the disk, in a space separated way.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 20 


Example:

Output:
1 A C
2 A B
1 C B
3 A C
1 B A
2 B C
1 A C
