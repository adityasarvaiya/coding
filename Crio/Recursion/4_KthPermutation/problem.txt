Write a program that will output the kth smallest permutation of an alphabet sequence of length N in English uppercase alphabets.

Given: Uppercase alphabets of length N = 1 is A, length N = 2 is AB , length N = 3 is ABC and so on.

All permutations of the above sequence with length 3 are (in order):
	1.ABC
	2.ACB
	3.BAC
	4.BCA
	5.CAB
	6.CBA

Input Format -
First line contains two integers representing the value of N and K, where N is the length of the alphabet sequence and the Kth permutation respectively.


Constraints-

1 <= N <= 18
1 <= K <= X, Where X is the value of N factorial.
 

Output Format -
Print a single string in Uppercase letters representing the kth permutation of the Alphabets.
