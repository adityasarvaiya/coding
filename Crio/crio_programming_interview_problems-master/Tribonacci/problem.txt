The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 
T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.

Constraints:
0<=n<=15

Input:
An integer n.

Output:
An integer Tn.

Example:
========

Input:
4

Output:
4

Explanation:
T4= T3 + T2 +T1 = 2 +1 + 1 = 4 
T3= T2 + T1 +T0 = 1 +1 + 0 = 2
