Given two arrays of integers, find a pair of values (one value from each array) that you can swap to give the two arrays the same sum.
If it is possible print "POSSIBLE", if the sum are already equal Print "ALREADY EQUAL", else print "NOT POSSIBLE".

Input:
First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of first array. Third line of each test case contains M space separated integers denoting the elements of second array.

Output:
Any of the three Lines:
Print "ALREADY EQUAL" without quotes if the sum of both arrays are equal.
Print "POSSIBLE" without quotes if there exists any such pair.
otherwise print "NOT POSSIBLE".

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= M <= 10^5
0 <= elements <= 10^8

Example:
=========
Input:
4 6 
1 6 3 3
4 1 2 1 1 2

Output:
POSSIBLE

Explanation:
 3 from 1st array and 2 from 2nd array when swapped makes the sum of both the arrays equal.
