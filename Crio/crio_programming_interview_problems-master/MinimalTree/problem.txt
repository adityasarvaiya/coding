Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
You need to output the height of the tree in a single line.

NOTE: In all other cases where tree is not a valid BST output would be -1.

Input Format:
First line n contains number of integers.
Next line contains n sorted integers.

Output Format:
You need to output the height of the tree in a single line.

Constraints:
n: number of integers(1<=n<=200000)
ai: array elements(1<=ai<=10^9)

=========
Example 1
=========
Input:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7


Output: 
3

Explanation:
So we have a tree with root 4 with minimum possible height 3.
