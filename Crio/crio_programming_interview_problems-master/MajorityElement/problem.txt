A majority element is an element that makes up more than half of the items in an array. Given a positive integers array, find the majority element. If there is no majority element, return -1. Do this in 0( N ) time and 0 ( 1 ) space.


Input:
The first line contains an interger N, The size of array . In the next line N  integers denotes the values of array.

Output:
Print the majority element. If there is no majority element, Print -1.

Constraint:
 
1<=N <=1000000
1<=A[i]<=1000000
