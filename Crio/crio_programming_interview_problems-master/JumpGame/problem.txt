Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Input:

In first line you ll be given the size of the array n.
Second line will have n space separated integers.

Output:

If it is possible to reach the end index then print "true" else print "false";


Constraints:

0 <= a[i] <= n-1
