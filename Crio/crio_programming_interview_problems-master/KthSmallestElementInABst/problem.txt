Problem Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Input format
First line contains N, number of elements in BST.
Next line contains N space-separated integers, the value of the ith element.
Next line contain 3 space-separated integers, describing the binary search tree.
Last line contains a single integer k.

Output format
Print the value of the kth smallest element.
