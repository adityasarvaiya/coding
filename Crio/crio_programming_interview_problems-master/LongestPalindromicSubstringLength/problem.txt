Given a string, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Substring. In a palindromic string, elements read the same backward and forward.

Input Format :
First line contains T - Number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains integer N - The length of String.
Second line of each test case contains string S.

Output Format :
Print the length of the Longest palindromic Substring for each test case in a separate line.

Constraints :
T <= 20
N <= 500
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Example 1
=========
Input :

2
6
abcpca
3
abc

Output :

3
1

Explanation :

In the 1st case the string 'cpc' is palindromic with length 3.
In the 2nd case 'a' can be considered as a palindrome with length 1.
