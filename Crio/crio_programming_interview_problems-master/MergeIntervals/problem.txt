Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Input format:
First line contains N, the number of intervals.
Next N lines contain 2 space separated integers A and B, which represent the start and end of an interval.

Output format
For the X merged intervals, print each interval (the start and end being space separated) on a separate line.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 50000
0 <= A, B <= 1e9
B >= A

=========
Example 1
=========

Input
4
1 3
2 6
8 10
15 18

Output
1 6
8 10
15 18

Explanation

Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

=========
Example 2
=========


Input
2
1 4
4 5


Output
1 5

Explanation

Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.


NOTE: return the intervals in sorted (use interval start as the key)
