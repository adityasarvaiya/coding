Shortest Supersequence: You are given two arrays, one shorter and one longer. Find the shortest subarray length in the longer array that contains all the elements in the shorter array. The items can appear in any order.

Input:
 The first line contains two integers N,M denoting the size of the arrays. The Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the values/elements in the array A. The third line contains M space separated integers denoting the values/elements in the array B.

Output:
Print in a new line, the length of the shortest subarray length in the longer array that contains all the elements in the shorter
array. If there does not exist any subarray in longer array which contains all the elements of the shorter subarray print -1.

Constraints:

1 <= N<=M <= 10^5
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
-10^9 <= B[i] <= 10^9

Input
4 9 
7 3 2 2 
11 2 10 7 2 3 2 9 6 

Output
4

Explaintation:
The subarray : 7 2 3 2 contains all elements of the shorter array so minimum length subarray is 4
