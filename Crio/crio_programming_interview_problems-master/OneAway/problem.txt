There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,remove a character, or replace a character.
Given T which is the number of test cases and for each test case you are given two strings A and B which consists of lowercase alphabetical letters, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

Input Format -
First line contains an integer representing the value of T.
In next T lines each line contains two space seperated strings A and B respectively.

Constraints-

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= length(A) <= 100000
1 <= length(B) <= 100000

Output Format -
For each test case print "True"(without quotes) if if they are one edit (or zero edits) away and "False" otherwise.

Example 1
=========
Input -
3
hello helloa
hello hel
cocol cool


Output -
True
False
True

Explanation-
'a' can be inserted in "hello" to form "helloa".
"hello" and "hel" are not one distance away.
'c' can be removed from "cocol" to form "cool".
