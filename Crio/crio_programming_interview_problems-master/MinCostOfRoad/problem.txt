There are n cities and there are roads in between some of the cities. Somehow all the roads are damaged simultaneously. We have to repair the roads to connect the cities again. 
There is a fixed cost to repair a particular road. 
Find out the minimum cost to connect all the cities by repairing roads. 

INPUT

First line contains two numbers N,M denoting number of nodes and number of edges respectively. 
Next M lines contain three numbers U V and W, U and V denoting the nodes edge is connected to and W denoting the weight of the edge. 

OUTPUT
Print out one number denoting the minimum cost to connect all the cities.

NOTE: It is sure that all the cities were connected before the roads were damaged.

Constraints
1<=N<=1000
0<=M<=MIN(N*(N+1)/2,100000)
1<=U,V<=N
-1000<=W<=1000
