In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers. For example, in the array [5, 8,6, 2, 3,4, 6), {8,6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

==========
Example 1
==========
Input:
5
5 3 1 2 3

Output:
5 1 3 2 3

Explanation:
In the above example 5 3 and 3 are peaks and
1 and 2 are valleys

==========
Example 2
==========
Input:
5
3 1 3 1 4

Output:
1 1 3 3 4

Explanation:
In this example 1, 3 and 4 are peaks and
1 and 3 are valleys
