You are given a string S you have to implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the original string. 
You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

Input Format-
A single line that contains the string S.

Output Format-
A single line that represents the compressed string as given in the problem.

Constraints-
1 <= length(S) <= 100000

=========
Example 1
=========
Input:
aabccccc

Output:
a2b1c5

Explanation: 
First 'a' repeats two times then 'b' doesn't repeats then 'c' repeats two times.
