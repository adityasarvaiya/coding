Given an array of positive numbers, where each element represents the max number of jumps that can be made forward from that element, write a program to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). Return -1 if it is not possible to reach the end of the array. If an element is 0, then we cannot move through that element.


Input:

First line will have an integer n denoting the length of the array.
Second line will have n space separated integers.

Output:

Minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array or -1 if it is not possible. 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= a[i] <= n-1

Example:
========

Input:

11
1 3 5 8 9 2 6 7 6 8 9

Output:

3

Explanation:

1 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9
Multiple sequence are possible but minimum possible length will be 3
