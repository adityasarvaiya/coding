Given a sorted integer array nums of length N, where the range of elements are in the inclusive range [lower, upper], return its missing ranges.

Input Format -
First line contains an integer representing the value of N.
Next line contains two space seperated integers representing the value of lower and upper respectively.
Next line contains N space seperated integers representing the array nums.

Constraints-
0 <= N <= 100000
-2147483648 <= lower,upper <= 2147483647
lower <= nums[i] <= upper

Output Format -
Print M lines where each line is a string representing the missing range and M is number of missing ranges.
Note: you don't have to print M.
