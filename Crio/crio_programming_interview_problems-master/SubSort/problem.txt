Given an array of integers write a method to find indices m and n such that if two sorted elements through m and n the entire array would be sorted. Minimise n- m that is find the smallest such sequence.
Input:
The first line of each test case is N, N is the size of the array. The second line of consists of N space seperated array elements A[i].

Output:
Print the starting and ending values of the subarray. If they are already sorted print two space seperated integers -1 -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^8

Example:
Input:
13
1 2 4 7 10 11 7 12 6 7 16 18 19

Output:
3 9

Explanation:
In the array, if sub sequence from 3 to 9 inclusive is sorted then the whole array becomes sorted .
