Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able
to look up the rank of a number x (the number of values less than or equal to x). Implement the data
structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track(int x),
which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x),
which returns the number of values less than or equal to x.

Input:
First line contains Q, the number of queries.
Next Q lines contain a character and a integer X.
character '+' is used to call track with integer X.
and '?' is used to call getRankOfNumber with integer(X).

Constraints
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= X <= 10^9

Input:
11
+ 4
+ 4
+ 5
? 4
+ 9
+ 7
? 13
+ 13
+ 3
? 3
? 1

Output:
2
5
1
0

Explanation:
The first query is 4, at that time the integers recieved are - 4, 4, 5.
There are 2 integers less than or equal to 4

Second query is 13, integers recieved are - 4, 4, 5, 9, 7.
There are 5 integers less than or equal to 13.

Similarly at the time of 3rd query there are only 1 integer less than or equal to 3.

There is no integer less than or equal to 1.
