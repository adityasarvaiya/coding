There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.
Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.


Input Format :
First line contains 2 integers N,E - Number of nodes & Length of times list.
Next E lines contain space separated 3 integers u,v,w - source node, target node, time taken.
Next line contains an integer K - The node where the signal is generated.  

Output Format :
Print the time taken by the signal to reach the last node.

Constraints :
N <= 500
E <= min(N*(N-1),100000) 
w <= 1000000 (10^6)
1 <= u,v <= N

Explanation :
In the given graph, the time required by the signal to reach node 1,2,3,4 will be 0,3,4,6 respectively.
