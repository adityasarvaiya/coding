Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

INPUT
Single line containing a 32 bit signed integer N

CONSTRAINTS
-2^31<=N<=2^31-1

OUTPUT
Single line containing a 32 bit signed integer denoting the reverse of N

=========
Example 1
=========
Input:
123

Output:
321

=========
Example 2
=========
Input:
-123

Output:
-321

=========
Example 3
=========
Input:
120

Output:
21

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
