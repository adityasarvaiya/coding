Problem Statement:

You are given to implement a stack which performs pushing ,popping , and has a function min which returns the minimum eiement present in the stack.
Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1 ) time.

 You will be given 3 types of queries. For each query you will be asked to perfrom suitable operations.
 For query 1 x : push an element 'x' into the stack.
 For query 2 : pop an element from the stack .
 For query 3 : Find the minimum element from the stack. If the stack is empty Print -1.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 10^8 , 0<= i< n

Input Format:

First line contain an integer n denoting the number of queries.
For each query of type 1 there will be two integers 1 and x and for type 2 and 3 only single integer 2 or 3.

Output Format:

For each query of type 3. Print the minimum element in a new line.

Input:
6
1 2
1 3
1 1
3
2
3

Output
1
2

 
Explaination
For the first query of input 3 stack contains 1,2,3 so the min element is 1.In 5th query 1 is popped out so min element is 2.
