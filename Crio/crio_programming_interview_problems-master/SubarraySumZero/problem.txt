Given an array of positive and negative numbers you need to find if there is any subarray with 0 sum.

NOTE: A subarray of an array is a set of contiguous elements having size at least 1.

Input Format:
First line contains single integer T denoting number of testcases.
For each test case a single integer N will be given
And for each test case second line will contain N number of test cases.

Output Format:
Print "Yes" if a subarray exist otherwise "No" in a single line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=N<=10000
Sum of N for all test cases will be <=200000
-10^5<=Ai<=10^5

=========
Example 1
=========
Input:
2
4
4 2 -2 5
2
1 -1

Output:
Yes
Yes


Explanation: 
For first test case {2,-2} will be the subset that sums to 0.
For second test case the whole array sums to 0.


=========
Example 2
=========
Input:
2
3
4 0 -2
3
3 2 -1

Output:
Yes
No

Explanation: 
For first test case {0} will be the subset that sums to 0.
For second test case there is no subarray that sums to 0.
