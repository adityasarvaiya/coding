Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns.The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them.Find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

Input Format:
First line will contain two space separated integers n and m respectively. n denotes the number of rows and m denotes the number of columns in the grid.
Next n lines will have m space separated integers which represent the grid ,0 means robot can enter this cell , 1 means this cell is blocked.

Output Format:
Print the path from (1,1) to (n,m) that the robot will take.Print the row,col separated by space of the cell in which the robot  arrives in new line.
Print 'Not Possible' if there is no path to reach (n,m) from (1,1).

Constraints:
1<=n,m<=1000
