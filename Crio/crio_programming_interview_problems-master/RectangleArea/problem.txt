We are given a list of (axis-aligned) rectangles.  Each rectangle[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2] , where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane.  Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note: y1 will always be 0.

Input:

First line will have n the number of rectangles.
Each of the n line will have 4 integers x1 y1 x2 y2.

Output:

Output total area covered modulo 10^9+7

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 40000
rectanges[i].length = 4
0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 10^9
The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed 2^63 - 1 and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed intege

Example:

Input:

3
0 0 2 2
1 0 2 3
1 0 3 1

Output:

6
