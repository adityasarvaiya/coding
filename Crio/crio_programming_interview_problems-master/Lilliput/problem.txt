You are in Lilliput the land of tiny beings. Here the person with smaller height is considered more intelligent. All the Lilliputians are standing in a straight line from 0 to n-1. You will be asked 2 types of query (u x y  and q x y) in [u x y] you have to update the height of the Lilliputian at x index to y and in [q x y] you have to tell the most intelligent lilliputians height in a range from l to r (both inclusive).

Input:

First line will have n representing the number of Lilliputians in Lilliput.
Second line will have n space separated integers denoting the height of each Lilliputian standing in the line.
Third line will have a number q denoting the number of queries.
Next q lines will have one of the two queries.

Output:
For each query output in a new line the height of the smallest Lilliputian.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50000
0 <= height[i] <= 1e9
1 <= q <= 50000
0 <= l <= r <= n-1
