Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.

Input Format:
The tree will be given alongwith the node for which you have to find the successor.
Q: Q number of queries will be given to you.


Output Format:
Print the value of the successor node. If it didn't exist then print -1.

Constraints:
1<= Number of nodes <= 20000
1<= Q <= 10000

Example 1
=========
Input:
3
5 4 6 
1 2 3
2 -1 -1
3 -1 -1
2
2
0


Output: 
-1
6

Explanation: 
There will be no successor of 2nd node.
The successor of node 0(having value 5) will be the 2nd node whose value is 6.
