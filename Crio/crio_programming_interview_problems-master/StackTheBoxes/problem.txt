You have n boxes, with length l, breadth b and height h. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in length, breadth and height. Compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.

Constraint:
1<=n<=1000
1<=l,b,h<=100000

Input Format:
First line will contain a number n denoting the number of boxes.

Next n lines will contain three space separated integers denoting length, breadth and height respectively of each box.

Output Format:
Print a single line with the maximum possible height of the stack.

5 4 3
4 3 2

Output:

5

Explanation:

First (5,4,3)box then above it the (4,3,2) box.
