Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

INPUT
First line contains one number denoting the number of integers in the array
Next line contains N numbers denoting the ith element of the array

CONSTRAINTS
1<=N<=1000000
0<=Ai<=1e9

OUTPUT
Single Line containing the number that occurs only once.
