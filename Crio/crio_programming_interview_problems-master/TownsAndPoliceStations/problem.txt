You are given a network cities. Major cities will have police stations. Jurisdiction of some cities comes under the nearest city having possible station available. 
First line will be N number of cities and B Bridges connecting the cities. Each bridge represents the distance of 1 between the connecting cities.So your task is to report the minimum distance between the city and it's jurisdiction city.

First line will contain the N number of cities and B bridges between them.
Next line onwards two space seperated integers will be given.

Output Format:
For ith line you need to print the minimum distance of ith city from it's jurisdiction city.

NOTE:
The Cities are represented as 1-based indexing.

Constraints:
