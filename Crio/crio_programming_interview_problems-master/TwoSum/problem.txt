Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example
=======
Input:
4
2 7 11 15
9

Output:
0 1

Explanation:
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].
