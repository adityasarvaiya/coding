Longest sub-array with equal number of alphabets and numeric characters

Given an array of alphanumeric characters. The task is to find the longest contiguous sub-array which has equal numbers of letters (alphabets) and numbers (numeric digits). Print the starting and ending index of this sub-array. If there are multiple results, output the one with the lowest starting index.


Input:
 The first line  is N.
 The second line consists of the input string.


Output:
 Print the starting and ending index of this sub-array. If there does not exist any subarray print -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
'A' ≤ S[i] ≤ 'Z' or  '0' ≤ S[i] ≤ '9'.

Example
=======

Input: 
7
ABX46Xa

Output
1 4

Explaination:

The required sub-array is "BX46"
X46X is also a valid sub-array of maximum
length but its starting index is not minimum.
