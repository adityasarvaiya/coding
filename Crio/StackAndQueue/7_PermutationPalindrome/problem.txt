Given T which is the number of test cases and for each test case you are given a string S which consists of both lowercase and uppercase alphabetical letters,you have to write a function to check if string S is a permutation of a palindrome or not.

Input Format -
First line contains an integer representing the value of T.
In next T lines each line contains the string S.

Constraints-

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= length(S) <= 100000


Output Format -
For each test case print "True"(without quotes) if it is a permutation of a palindrome and "False" otherwise.
