Given an array A of size N having distinct elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. If no such element exists, output -1 

Input:
 The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. The Second line of each test case contains N space separated positive integers denoting the values/elements in the array A.

Output:
Print in a new line, the next greater element for each array element separated by space in order. If no such element exists, output -1 

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= Ai <= 10^9

==========
Example 1
==========

Input
4
1 3 2 4
Output
3 4 4 -1


Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 it doesn't exist hence -1.
